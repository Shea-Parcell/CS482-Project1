    For section 1.2, We advice to Eve would be to identify the frequency of single characters, digraphs, and trigraphs.

Firstly, The single letters could directly be linked in order of frequency, so assigning the highest frequency ciphertext character 
to e would be a smart move. Keep it going for the rest of the set of highest frequencies and note those. 

Next, look at the digraphs and see what characters leak over from the single letters. Trying different frequently used characters 
in place of others, like maybe T is the most frequently used instead of E, try it.

Finally, look at the most frequently used trigraphs, and notice how some of them overlap. For instance, T, H, and E are all in the 
highest frequency for single use characters. TH and HE are in the highest frequency of digraphs, as well as E being in most pairs.
THE is the most frequently used trigraph as well, so locking these three in makes adding the other less frequently used characters much easier.
