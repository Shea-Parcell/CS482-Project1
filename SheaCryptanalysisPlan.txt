1.2.2 - Plan

To crack the simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher my approach is to use statistical characteristics
By analyising the ciphertext and finding the most common letters in the ciphertext. 
The most frequently appearing single letters in English are: E, T, A, O, N, I, S, R, and H. Knowing this 
we can look at the ciphertext and make some guesstimates at what in the ciphertext might correspond to those letters

Next by looking at the most common digraphs: TH, HE, AN, IN, ER, RE, and ES we can further guesstimate and find what fits best statistically
And finally by looking at the most common trigraphs: THE, AND, THA, ENT, ION, TIO we can isolate portions of the ciphertext and use those portions to find other letters.
For example we know that following THA that THAT could be the decrypted work or if not that then maybe THANK.
